working through some demo's on javascript. Comes from the book "HTML5 Javascript &amp; jQuery" by Dane Cameron

So I'm just working through this book on JS and JQuery to get some Front End skills down. 

Once I go through it some I'll try to actually make a full-stack app and probably go into my previous apps and beef them up.
